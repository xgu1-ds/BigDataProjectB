By   : Xin Gu, Shuang Zhou

## Introduction

In this project, we chose the data sets from Capital Bikeshare. The data sets recorded the Capital Bikeshare trip data with trip information of date, start and end station, bike number and member type from 2010 to Oct. 2019. Historical data is valuable for business owner to draw insights, identify issues and forecast future trends. For Capital Bikeshare, with the usage and growth of their system, it would be wise to have a data management plan to fit the needs of big data and gradually build their assets as in big data .
In the report, we recorded detailed methodology about data management pipeline implementation, took a closer look at the data by exploratory data analysis and built a regression model to predict total number of bikes needed for each hour of each day. We also proposed a way to train a better model for more accurate prediction.
